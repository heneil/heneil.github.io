Hi! I'm a first year PhD student in computer science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), advised by Prof. [Ge Liu](https://www.mit.edu/~geliu/), where I'm supported by an Amazon AI PhD Fellowship. Previously, I obtained my Bachelors and Masters in Mathematics at Yale University, advised by Prof. [Rex Ying](https://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/ying-rex/) and Prof. [Menglin Yang](https://facultyprofiles.hkust-gz.edu.cn/faculty-personal-page?id=509). I'm mainly insterested in geometric deep learning, such as generative modelling on Riemannian manifolds and non-Euclidean foundation models, with applications in the natural sciences such as protein synthesis. I'm also broadly interested in exploring how to build foundation models for structured datasets, particularly for real-world applications. Reach out to talk about exciting research ideas, tennis, or reptiles preservations!
